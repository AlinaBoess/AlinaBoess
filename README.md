# 👋 Hi, I’m Alina

🏫 I'm currently studying **Computer Science (B.Sc.)** in my 4th semester.  
👀 I'm passionate about **learning new skills** and constantly improving myself.  

🌱 I'm currently focusing on:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **C# with .NET**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Blazor**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **SQL**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Basics of **HTML** & **CSS**

🔧 I also have some experience with:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Arduino** (C/C++)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **Java**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• **JavaScript**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• ...

🏹 In my free time, I enjoy **archery** and 🎺 **playing the trumpet**.
